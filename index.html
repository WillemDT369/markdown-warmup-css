        <h3>A funny story</h3>
        <p>When I was little my brother and I loved watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
            We liked playing like if we where them. One day we wanted to climb out of the window 
            with a rope with a hook attached to it. We made the hook ourselves from an 
            iron wire. Not such a good idea since we were able to bend it. Conclusion, we fell 
            out of the window.</p>
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>"I'll better do it myself" doesn't always apply.</p>
